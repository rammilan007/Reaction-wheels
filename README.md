# Reaction-wheels
contains Simulink model of reaction wheels based on a research paper Link <https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_H73xWTP3CqVEs5NnBfdnlUWnc>
Though the expressions used for angular momentum seems unsatisfactory to me,I went ahead with those equations. I found the results of the simulations unsatisfactory. May be the system needed controller to form a stable closed loop control system.

Later I came to derive those equations by my own way.Link to those derivations <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_gF3Ed-5PEUcavpCLzkts7eXtRkfyA3c>. Please note that the simulations based on this new derived is not done because i stopped working on this.
